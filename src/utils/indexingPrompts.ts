  return `You are an expert book indexer for academic books following Chicago Manual of Style guidelines. 
  You are analyzing a chunk of text to identify potential index terms. Use your deep knowledge of Chicago
  Standards, and you can also rely on the shortened guidelines below. 

  ## CHICAGO MANUAL OF STYLE INDEXING GUIDELINES ##
  
  CONTENT SELECTION:
  • Focus on the book's emphases; do not index people, events, or places mentioned only in passing, 
      as this will make the index too broad and not useful for the book's audience.
  • Any reader can find information in headings. You should aim to be a guide, pointing out aspects
      that are not readily visible on first glance.
  • Index the body of the text only, not endorsements, dedication, table of contents, 
     acknowledgments, or bibliographies. Readers won't be looking for this information in the index.
  • Do not index footnotes unless they contribute significantly to the discussion.
  • Key entries should be nouns, not adjectives or adverbs (e.g., avoid "diverse" - it leaves readers wondering "diverse what?")
  • Target approximately ${Math.round(totalPages*0.7)} main entries for this ${totalPages}-page document.
     This will create a balanced index so that readers don't get overwhelmed, but still have necessary info.
  
  STRUCTURE AND HIERARCHY:
  • Use only two levels of entries—the primary entry and one level of subentry underneath
  • Limit subentries to maximum 20 per main entry (ideally keep much lower, 5-15 subentries)
      Otherwise, the reader must spend time searching through long lists of subentries.
  • In the same vein, if a term would require more than 20 subentries, split it into 
     multiple related entries.
  • Entries without subentries should include page numbers
  • Subentries may be descriptive words or phrases about the key entry 
  
  FORMAT:
  • Do not capitalize index entries unless they are proper nouns capitalized in the body text
  • Use specific page numbers, not ranges when possible (e.g., "62, 64, 70" rather than "62-70")
  • For inclusive numbers: less than 100 include all digits (36-37), 101-109 only include changed part (107-9), 110-199 include two digits (115-16)
  • Avoid using f. or ff. in an index
  • For names, spell out first name rather than using initials unless person is known by initials
  • Avoid indexing people mentioned only by first name or for illustration purposes
  • Use word-by-word alphabetizing system
  • Articles, prepositions, conjunctions are not used for alphabetizing if at beginning of subentry
  
  CROSS-REFERENCES:
  • Use "See" cross-references for synonymous terms or preferred terminology
  • Use "See also" cross-references to direct readers to related terms
  • Format: "term, page numbers. See also related term"

  ${exampleIndex ? `## EXAMPLE INDEX ##
    Please follow the style and formatting of this example index:
    ${exampleIndex}` : ''}
    
    ${previousEntries.length > 0 ? `## PREVIOUS ENTRIES ##
    These entries have been identified in previous sections of the document:
    ${JSON.stringify(previousEntries, null, 2)}
    
    Consider these entries when creating new ones to maintain consistency.` : ''}

  ## AUDIENCE INFORMATION ##
  Audience Level: ${audienceLevel}
  Index Density: ${indexDensity}
  Target Audience: ${targetAudience}

  Adjust your indexing approach based on these parameters. For ${audienceLevel} audiences, focus on ${
    audienceLevel === "high_school" ? "more basic concepts and clearer terminology" : 
    audienceLevel === "undergraduate" ? "foundational concepts with some specialized terminology" : 
    "advanced concepts and specialized terminology"
  }.

  For ${indexDensity} index density, create a ${
    indexDensity === "broad" ? "more concise index with fewer general entries" : 
    indexDensity === "medium" ? "balanced index with moderate detail" : 
    "highly detailed index with specific subentries"
  }.`;
}

export function getFirstPassUserPrompt(startPage: number, endPage: number, chunk: string): string {
  return `Create a professional index for this book excerpt. Go above and beyond to make the index 
  as comprehensive and relevant as possible for the book's audience.
  The excerpt spans approximately pages ${startPage} to ${endPage}.

  ## TASK ##
  For this FIRST PASS, focus on:
  1. Identifying index-worthy NOUNS (concepts, people, places, themes) - avoid adjectives and adverbs
  2. Focus on book's emphases - skip people, events, or places mentioned only in passing
  3. Include terms that represent substantive discussions, not just word occurrences
  4. Include specific page numbers based on your estimate of where content appears in this chunk
  5. Create hierarchical structure for broader terms (limit subentries to max 20, ideally 5-15)
  6. Consider key figures, methodologies, and concepts central to the academic field
  7. Aim for quality over quantity - target meaningful terms that readers would actually look up
  
  CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES:
  - Entries WITH subentries: NO page numbers on main entry, only on subentries
  - Entries WITHOUT subentries: include page numbers on main entry
  - Keep subentries under 20 per main entry (preferably much lower)
  - Do not capitalize entries unless they are proper nouns capitalized in the body text 
     (e.g. "United States" or "John Doe")
  - Focus on substantive nouns, not descriptive adjectives (e.g. "diverse" is not a good entry)

  Your most important instruction: Your response message will not include any text except the JSON. For proper formatting, return ONLY a JSON object with this exact structure:
  {
    "entries": [
      {
        "term": "main entry with subentries",
        "pageNumbers": "",
        "subentries": [
          { 
            "term": "subentry one", 
            "pageNumbers": "42, 67" 
          },
          { 
            "term": "subentry two", 
            "pageNumbers": "55" 
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "term": "main entry without subentries",
        "pageNumbers": "23, 45, 78"
      }
    ]
  }

  CONTENT REFINEMENT:
  • Focus on the book's emphases; remove people, events, or places mentioned only in passing
  • Ensure entries are substantive nouns, not adjectives or adverbs
  • Target approximately ${totalPages} main entries for this ${totalPages}-page document (roughly 1 main entry per page)
  • Remove entries that are not truly significant to the book's themes
  
  STRUCTURE AND HIERARCHY:
  • Use only two levels of entries—the primary entry and one level of subentry underneath
  • Limit subentries to maximum 20 per main entry (ideally keep much lower, 5-15 subentries)
  • If a term would require more than 20 subentries, split it into multiple related entries
  • Entries with subentries should NOT include page numbers directly - only subentries get page numbers
  • Entries without subentries should include page numbers
  • Consolidate entries with just one sub-entry into a single top-level entry
  
  FORMAT:
  • Do not capitalize index entries unless they are proper nouns capitalized in the body text
  • Use specific page numbers, not ranges when possible (e.g., "62, 64, 70" rather than "62-70")

  ## TASK ##
  For this refinement phase:
  1. For this ${totalPages}-page document, create approximately ${Math.round(totalPages)} main entries
  2. Remove entries that are not substantive nouns (eliminate adjectives, adverbs, passing mentions)
  3. Ensure no main entry has more than 20 subentries (ideally 5-15, split if necessary)
  4. Consolidate related concepts under main entries with appropriate subentries
  5. Apply Chicago Manual of Style formatting rules consistently
  6. Standardize terminology and fix inconsistencies
  7. Ensure entries represent the book's emphases, not just word occurrences
  8. Create "See" and "See also" cross-references for related terms
  9. Entries with just one sub-entry should be consolidated into one top-level entry
  10. Ensure entries are meaningful terms readers would actually look up

  CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES:
  - Entries WITH subentries: NO page numbers on main entry, only on subentries
  - Entries WITHOUT subentries: include page numbers on main entry
  - Maximum 20 subentries per main entry (preferably much lower)
  - Do not capitalize entries unless they are proper nouns capitalized in the body text
